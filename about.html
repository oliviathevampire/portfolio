                <h2>How I Started With Programming</h2>
                <li>Way back in 2016 or maybe earlier I started to get interested in coding by first doing web development and then I started on a local coding club for young people to learn coding, and to help eachother learn more which was super fun.</li>
                <li>Then I started doing Minecraft modding possibly not long after I started with web-dev which is how I learned Java and have been doing Minecraft modding since 2016 and up until now.</li>
                <li>In August 2022 I started studying Game Development at Bjerkely Folk Highschool, which was super interesting. Learned how to do coding in Unity, how to do art, music and a bit more.</li>
                <li>Before I started at Bjerkely tho, I had worked a tiny bit with Godot Engine and a super tiny bit with Unity. But learned way more about Unity when started studying game development.</li>
